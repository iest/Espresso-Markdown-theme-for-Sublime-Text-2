# A Pretty Markdown theme

Based on [Federico Viticci's theme](http://www.macstories.net/roundups/sublime-text-2-and-markdown-tips-tricks-and-links/#more-31715), which was based on the [MarkdownEditing theme](http://ttscoff.github.com/MarkdownEditing/).

Some styles taken from [Gunther Groenewege's Mou theme](http://groenewege.tumblr.com/post/12340005412/mou-theme-espresso) originally inspired by [Espresso.app](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)
